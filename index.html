		<h3><b>Warrantless Intercepts</b></h3>
		<br/>
I'm somewhat troubled by the conclusions that some people are drawing with respect to the current political firestorm surrounding the NSA communictaion intercepts. Some in Congress naturally see it as a violation of their statute, while others could see the statute itself as an infringement upon the Article II powers of the President. I'll present some hypotheticals that I think will lead to some more logical conclusions in this area.
<br/>
Hypo #1: You are a 21 year old male, attending a college. You meet an have started dating a girl attending the same school, let's call her Meadow Soprano. She is the daugher of a high ranking member of organized crime. You place calls to her home and cell phone. The FBI has a proper warrant authorizng them to wiretap the phones, including cell phones, of all members of the household. Your conversations are thus recorded by the FBI. The FBI does not suspect you, nor does it have a warrant to record your phone calls. Has the FBI done anything wrong? Have your rights been violated?
<br/>
Hypo #2: The CIA and NSA have discovered the code for a cell phone owned by an al Qaeda leader who operates out of Syria. They can now intercept and record all his calls. In the interest of national security they intercept and record several phone calls made to individuals in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Iran. They have no warrant to do this. Has the NSA done anything wrong? Have any U.S. laws been broken? Can the President authorize this conduct?
<br/>
Hypo #3: The man in Hypo #2 also calls a man who lives in Newark, NJ on several occasions. The NSA intercepts these calls and records them, as it did the calls to individuals outside the U.S. The NSA does not obtain a warrant. Has the NSA done anything wrong? Have they vioated the New Jersey man's rights under the fourth amendment?
<br/>
ANSWERS:
Hypo #1. Your rights have not been violated. The warrant authorizes the recording and the FBI has done nothing wrong.
<br/>
Hypo #2. The President clearly has this authority and no member of Congress would dispute that he does. The NSA has done nothing wrong and no laws have been broken.
<br/>
Hypo #3. As we see in Hypo #2, the authorization of the intercepts, for national security purposes, is a valid exercise of Presidential power. As we saw in Hypo #1, it is irrelevant who the al Qaeda leader calls and who is on the other end of the line if the authorization is valid with respect to one party to the conversation.
<br/>
HOWEVER, Congress makes the criminal laws and can shape the rules of evidence. It has done so. Therefore, unless the NSA obtains a warrant, as authoized by Congress, it cannot use the information obtained in Hypo #3 to prosecute the man from New Jersey.
<br/>
So let's apply this to the present situation. The executive branch has requested thousands of warrants under FISA and yet it has failed to do so in other instances. The executive branch, which is charged with enforcement and prosecution of the laws, probably did not bother to obtain warrants in those instances where: (1) the U.S. individual was not likely to be charged or face prosecution or (2) where the information obtained was not likely to be useful in any criminal proceeding. This is common sense. To the extent that FISA attempts to limit the ability of the President to gather intelligence on foreign persons or nations, as in Hypo #2, it is Unconstitutional. Congress has no such authority. Congress can proscribe rules related to the use of information gathered in Hypo #3 in criminal cases, and has done so. Those provisions are Constitutional.
<br/>
UPDATE: If you like, you can see what Al Gore has to say on this subject by watching his speech live on CSPAN.

	<h3><b>Been a long time....</b></h3>
	<br/>
...since I've blogged anything. Despite encouragement from some (which is appreciated), and flurries of activity, the real world continues to demand all of my time. I even missed some great stories in the last month or so, stories I would have loved to write about. I know several other bloggers have gone through this, Allah and LaShawn Barber to name two. Some bloggers have turned their blogs into caeers, with radio and tv appearances, syndicated columns and so on. But for the rest of you I ask, how do you do it? What kind of jobs do you have? I'm rather sure that blogging during work would lead to my termination.

		<h3><b>Cleaning House At The House</b></h3>
Of course, the Senate needs is every bit as much...but we'll get to that later. The Truth Laid Bear is putting forth a call for center-right bloggers to clean up the leadership of the house. I'll admit that Abramoff taint is no worse in my view that the vast sums spent on local pork for their constituents. Fixing one without the other won't accomplish much, but I support the effort. Perhaps some fiscal propriety will carry over to spending bills. Here's the TTLB appeal, to which I'm happy to add the Secure Liberty voice.
We are bloggers with boatloads of opinions, and none of us come close to agreeing with any other one of us all of the time. But we do agree on this: The new leadership in the House of Representatives needs to be thoroughly and transparently free of the taint of the Jack Abramoff scandals, and beyond that, of undue influence of K Street.
We are not naive about lobbying, and we know it can and has in fact advanced crucial issues and has often served to inform rather than simply influence Members.
<br/>
But we are certain that the public is disgusted with excess and with privilege. We hope the Hastert-Dreier effort leads to sweeping reforms including the end of subsidized travel and other obvious influence operations. Just as importantly, we call for major changes to increase openness, transparency and accountability in Congressional operations and in the appropriations process.
<br/>
As for the Republican leadership elections, we hope to see more candidates who will support these goals, and we therefore welcome the entry of Congressman John Shadegg to the race for Majority Leader. We hope every Congressman who is committed to ethical and transparent conduct supports a reform agenda and a reform candidate. And we hope all would-be members of the leadership make themselves available to new media to answer questions now and on a regular basis in the future.
